Sweet you made it past the pre-requisite & Installation, we are now at the post configuration which is very fun. In this screenshot we will be adding agents and roles they will be playing. We first want to click admin panel on the top right corner. Then click agents > Roles > Then Create new role. Once Supreme Admin has been created, go to permissions > Tasks > KnowledgeBase and check all of the boxes. This will make Supreme Admin even MORE surpreme.

Select the "Departments" button in the agents tab. Here we will be able to create a new department. Each Agent is assigned to a specific department depending on their assigned role within the helpdesk. In this case we will be creating the "System Administrators" department, this is where the Supreme Admins will be designated. Other specific settings such as SLAs, managers and other email settings can be set up in the departments tab.

Wonderful, next step is we will head over to Department and create a role called “System Administrator”. Don’t worry about changing any SLA, Ticket Assignment and such, we will work on that later.

We will be creating 2 more agents to join our team. Just type in easy names you will remember such as “Jane or John”. When you get to the Authentication section, make sure to “Set a Password” and hit set. You will have to adjust Access, Permission and Teams to your liking as well..

After the agents have joined our team, its time to get started with work. We can’t work without customers right? In order to add them, we will need to go back to the Agent Panel, click Users and add the customers. I will be adding a Karen into my project because who doesn’t love a Karen?

<p>
Okay now we will create SLA. We need to go back to Admin Panel > Manage > SLA. We will be adding 3 Severity level tickets, Severity level tickets means it will show the workers how urgent tickets are, when they need to be done and what the reason is for. Like in this example, I have create Sev-A with a Grace Period of 1 hour, 24/7. This means that our team needs to finish this ticket in 1 hour because Sev-A is an Emergency ticket. Create Sev-A, Sev-B, & Sev-C.

</p>
<p>
The final part is we will be adding Help Topics. Help Topics will determine what type of problem the ticket is referring to, for example: Someone needs to reset their password and needs help or attention from the higher ups. They will submit a ticket under Password Reset and when someone on the team sees this, they can resolve the issue.

<p>
Help topics help users categorize their tickets. In the example below we have made a help topic for "Business Critical Outage" this can be if customers cannot access mobile banking.
